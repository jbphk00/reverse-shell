# Instructions to Follow
First, you need to specify a port to connect to using netcat with the following command: "nc -lvp 4444"
Once started, on the victim machine, enter the specific code for the system operative (In a attached file above, Just download it), which will connect to the attacker. Once this command is executed, you will have remote access to the victim machine from the attacker machine.

If you prefer another method, you can create an HTML file that you just need to execute on the victim machine with the corresponding code inside.

Remember to replace [ATTACKER_IP] !
